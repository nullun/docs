title: Node configuration settings
Nodes can be configured with different options. These options will determine some of the capabilities of the node and whether it functions as a relay node or a non-relay node. This involves setting parameters in the configuration file for either the `algod` or `kmd` process. 

The configuration file (`config.json`) for the `algod` process is located in the node's `data` directory. 
If it does not exist, it needs to be created.
A full example is provided as `config.json.example`.
However, it is strongly recommended to only specify the parameters with non-default values in a custom `config.json` file, otherwise, when the algod software is updated, you may be using older non-recommended values for some of the parameters.

Concretely, the `config.json` for an archival node should usually just be:
```json
{
    "Archival": true
}
```

!!! info
    Archival nodes retain a full copy of the ledger (blockchain). Non-Archival nodes will delete old blocks and only retain what's needed to properly validate blockchain messages (currently the last 1000 blocks). Archival nodes can be used to populate indexer data. See chart below for more details.


The configuration file (`kmd_config.json`) for `kmd` is located in the nodes `data/kmd-version` (rename `kmd_config.json.example') directory. 

See [Node Types](../../run-a-node/setup/types.md) for more information.

!!! info
    All changes require the node to be restarted to take effect.

!!! warning
    Changing some parameter values can have drastic negative impact on performance. In particular, never set `IsIndexerActive` to `true`. This activates the very slow deprecated V1 indexer. If indexer is required, use the [V2 indexer](../../../get-details/indexer).
 
# algod Configuration Settings
The `algod` process configuration parameters are shown in the table below.

| Property| Description | Default Value | 
|------|------|------|
| Version | Version tracks the current version of the defaults so we can migrate old -> new<br>This is specifically important whenever we decide to change the default value<br>for an existing parameter. This field tag must be updated any time we add a new version. | 30 |
| Archival | environmental (may be overridden)<br>When enabled, stores blocks indefinitely, otherwise, only the most recent blocks<br>are being kept around. ( the precise number of recent blocks depends on the consensus parameters ) | false |
| GossipFanout | gossipNode.go<br>how many peers to propagate to? | 4 |
| ReconnectTime | 1 * time.Minute = 60000000000 ns | 60000000000 |
| PublicAddress | The public address to connect to that is advertised to other nodes.<br>For MainNet relays, make sure this entry includes the full SRV host name<br>plus the publicly-accessible port number.<br>A valid entry will avoid "self-gossip" and is used for identity exchange<br>to deduplicate redundant connections |  |
| PeerPingPeriodSeconds | 0 == disable | 0 |
| TLSCertFile | for https serving |  |
| BaseLoggerDebugLevel | Logging | 4 |

| BroadcastConnectionsLimit | BroadcastConnectionsLimit specifies the number of connections that<br>will receive broadcast (gossip) messages from this node.  If the<br>node has more connections than this number, it will send broadcasts<br>to the top connections by priority (outgoing connections first, then<br>by money held by peers based on their participation key).  0 means<br>no outgoing messages (not even transaction broadcasting to outgoing<br>peers).  -1 means unbounded (default). | -1 |
| AnnounceParticipationKey | AnnounceParticipationKey specifies that this node should announce its<br>participation key (with the largest stake) to its gossip peers.  This<br>allows peers to prioritize our connection, if necessary, in case of a<br>DoS attack.  Disabling this means that the peers will not have any<br>additional information to allow them to prioritize our connection. | true |
| PriorityPeers | PriorityPeers specifies peer IP addresses that should always get<br>outgoing broadcast messages from this node. |  |
| ReservedFDs | To make sure the algod process does not run out of FDs, algod ensures<br>that RLIMIT_NOFILE >= IncomingConnectionsLimit + RestConnectionsHardLimit +<br>ReservedFDs. ReservedFDs are meant to leave room for short-lived FDs like<br>DNS queries, SQLite files, etc. This parameter shouldn't be changed.<br>If RLIMIT_NOFILE < IncomingConnectionsLimit + RestConnectionsHardLimit + ReservedFDs<br>then either RestConnectionsHardLimit or IncomingConnectionsLimit decreased. | 256 |

In the case of CloudFlare proxy, the "CF-Connecting-IP" header<br>field can be used. |  |
| ForceRelayMessages | ForceRelayMessages indicates whether the network library relay messages even in the case that no NetAddress was specified. | false |
| ConnectionsRateLimitingWindowSeconds | ConnectionsRateLimitingWindowSeconds is being used in conjunction with ConnectionsRateLimitingCount;<br>see ConnectionsRateLimitingCount description for further information. Providing a zero value<br>in this variable disables the connection rate limiting. | 1 |
| ConnectionsRateLimitingCount | ConnectionsRateLimitingCount is being used along with ConnectionsRateLimitingWindowSeconds to determine if<br>a connection request should be accepted or not.

| EnablePingHandler | EnablePingHandler controls whether the gossip node would respond to ping messages with a pong message. | true |
| DisableOutgoingConnectionThrottling | DisableOutgoingConnectionThrottling disables the connection throttling of the network library, which<br>allow the network library to continuesly disconnect relays based on their relative ( and absolute ) performance. | false |
| NetworkProtocolVersion | NetworkProtocolVersion overrides network protocol version ( if present ) |  |
| CatchpointInterval | CatchpointInterval sets the interval at which catchpoint are being generated. Setting this to 0 disables the catchpoint from being generated.<br>See CatchpointTracking for more details. | 10000 |
| CatchpointFileHistoryLength | CatchpointFileHistoryLength defines how many catchpoint files we want to store back.<br>0 means don't store any, -1 mean unlimited and positive number suggest the number of most recent catchpoint files. | 365 |
| EnableLedgerService | EnableLedgerService enables the ledger serving service. The functionality of this depends on NetAddress, which must also be provided.<br>This functionality is required for the catchpoint catchup. | false |
| EnableBlockService | EnableBlockService enables the block serving service. The functionality of this depends on NetAddress, which must also be provided.<br>This functionality is required for the catchup. | false |
| EnableGossipBlockService | EnableGossipBlockService enables the block serving service over the gossip network. The functionality of this depends on NetAddress, which must also be provided.<br>This functionality is required for the relays to perform catchup from nodes. | true |
| CatchupHTTPBlockFetchTimeoutSec | CatchupHTTPBlockFetchTimeoutSec controls how long the http query for fetching a block from a relay would take before giving up and trying another relay. | 4 |

| LedgerSynchronousMode | LedgerSynchronousMode defines the synchronous mode used by the ledger database. The supported options are:<br>0 - SQLite continues without syncing as soon as it has handed data off to the operating system.<br>1 - SQLite database engine will still sync at the most critical moments, but less often than in FULL mode.<br>2 - SQLite database engine will use the xSync method of the VFS to ensure that all content is safely written to the disk surface prior to continuing. On Mac OS, the data is additionally syncronized via fullfsync.<br>3 - In addition to what being done in 2, it provides additional durability if the commit is followed closely by a power loss.<br>for further information see the description of SynchronousMode in dbutil.go | 2 |
| AccountsRebuildSynchronousMode | AccountsRebuildSynchronousMode defines the synchronous mode used by the ledger database while the account database is being rebuilt. This is not a typical operational usecase,<br>and is expected to happen only on either startup ( after enabling the catchpoint interval, or on certain database upgrades ) or during fast catchup. The values specified here<br>and their meanings are identical to the ones in LedgerSynchronousMode. | 1 |
| MaxCatchpointDownloadDuration | MaxCatchpointDownloadDuration defines the maximum duration a client will be keeping the outgoing connection of a catchpoint download request open for processing before<br>shutting it down. Networks that have large catchpoint files, slow connection or slow storage could be a good reason to increase this value. Note that this is a client-side only<br>configuration value, and it's independent of the actual catchpoint file size. | 43200000000000 |
| MinCatchpointFileDownloadBytesPerSecond | MinCatchpointFileDownloadBytesPerSecond defines the minimal download speed that would be considered to be "acceptable" by the catchpoint file fetcher, measured in bytes per seconds. If the<br>provided stream speed drops below this threshold, the connection would be recycled. Note that this field is evaluated per catchpoint "chunk" and not on it's own. If this field is zero,<br>the default of 20480 would be used. | 20480 |

| VerifiedTranscationsCacheSize | VerifiedTranscationsCacheSize defines the number of transactions that the verified transactions cache would hold before cycling the cache storage in a round-robin fashion. | 150000 |
| EnableCatchupFromArchiveServers | EnableCatchupFromArchiveServers controls which peers the catchup service would use in order to catchup.<br>When enabled, the catchup service would use the archive servers before falling back to the relays.<br>On networks that doesn't have archive servers, this becomes a no-op, as the catchup service would have no<br>archive server to pick from, and therefore automatically selects one of the relay nodes. | false |
| DisableLocalhostConnectionRateLimit | DisableLocalhostConnectionRateLimit controls whether the incoming connection rate limit would apply for<br>connections that are originating from the local machine. Setting this to "true", allow to create large<br>local-machine networks that won't trip the incoming connection limit observed by relays. | true |
| BlockServiceCustomFallbackEndpoints | BlockServiceCustomFallbackEndpoints is a comma delimited list of endpoints which the block service uses to<br>redirect the http requests to in case it does not have the round. If it is not specified, will check<br>EnableBlockServiceFallbackToArchiver. |  |
| EnableBlockServiceFallbackToArchiver | EnableBlockServiceFallbackToArchiver controls whether the block service redirects the http requests to<br>an archiver or return StatusNotFound (404) when in does not have the requested round, and<br>BlockServiceCustomFallbackEndpoints is empty.<br>The archiver is randomly selected, if none is available, will return StatusNotFound (404). | true |
| CatchupBlockValidateMode | CatchupBlockValidateMode is a development and testing configuration used by the catchup service.<br>It can be used to omit certain validations to speed up the catchup process, or to apply extra validations which are redundant in normal operation.<br>This field is a bit-field with:<br>bit 0: (default 0) 0: verify the block certificate; 1: skip this validation<br>bit 1: (default 0) 0: verify payset committed hash in block header matches payset hash; 1: skip this validation<br>bit 2: (default 0) 0: don't verify the transaction signatures on the block are valid; 1: verify the transaction signatures on block<br>bit 3: (default 0) 0: don't verify that the hash of the recomputed payset matches the hash of the payset committed in the block header; 1: do perform the above verification<br>Note: not all permutations of the above bitset are currently functional. In particular, the ones that are functional are:<br>0  : default behavior.<br>3  : speed up catchup by skipping necessary validations<br>12 : perform all validation methods (normal and additional). These extra tests helps to verify the integrity of the compiled executable against<br>     previously used executabled, and would not provide any additional security guarantees. | 0 |
| EnableAccountUpdatesStats | Generate AccountUpdates telemetry event | false |
| AccountUpdatesStatsInterval | Time interval in nanoseconds for generating accountUpdates telemetry event | 5000000000 |
| ParticipationKeysRefreshInterval | ParticipationKeysRefreshInterval is the duration between two consecutive checks to see if new participation<br>keys have been placed on the genesis directory. | 60000000000 |
| DisableNetworking | DisableNetworking disables all the incoming and outgoing communication a node would perform. This is useful<br>when we have a single-node private network, where there is no other nodes that need to be communicated with.<br>features like catchpoint catchup would be rendered completly non-operational, and many of the node inner<br>working would be completly dis-functional. | false |
| ForceFetchTransactions | ForceFetchTransactions allows to explicitly configure a node to retrieve all the transactions<br>into it's transaction pool, even if those would not be required as the node doesn't<br>participate in the consensus or used to relay transactions. | false |
| EnableVerbosedTransactionSyncLogging | EnableVerbosedTransactionSyncLogging enables the transaction sync to write extensive<br>message exchange information to the log file. This option is disabled by default,<br>so that the log files would not grow too rapidly. | false |
| TransactionSyncDataExchangeRate | TransactionSyncDataExchangeRate overrides the auto-calculated data exchange rate between each<br>two peers. The unit of the data exchange rate is in bytes per second. Setting the value to<br>zero implies allowing the transaction sync to dynamically calculate the value. | 0 |
| TransactionSyncSignificantMessageThreshold | TransactionSyncSignificantMessageThreshold define the threshold used for a transaction sync<br>message before it can be used for calculating the data exchange rate. Setting this to zero<br>would use the default values. The threshold is defined in units of bytes. | 0 |
| ProposalAssemblyTime | ProposalAssemblyTime is the max amount of time to spend on generating a proposal block. | 500000000 |
| RestConnectionsSoftLimit | When the number of http connections to the REST layer exceeds the soft limit,<br>we start returning http code 429 Too Many Requests. | 1024 |
| RestConnectionsHardLimit | The http server does not accept new connections as long we have this many<br>(hard limit) connections already. | 2048 |

| EnableUsageLog | EnableUsageLog enables 10Hz log of CPU and RAM usage.<br>Also adds 'algod_ram_usage` (number of bytes in use) to /metrics | false |
| MaxAPIBoxPerApplication | MaxAPIBoxPerApplication defines the maximum total number of boxes per application that will be returned<br>in GetApplicationBoxes REST API responses. | 100000 |
| TxIncomingFilteringFlags | TxIncomingFilteringFlags instructs algod filtering incoming tx messages<br>Flag values:<br>0x00 - disabled<br>0x01 (txFilterRawMsg) - check for raw tx message duplicates<br>0x02 (txFilterCanonical) - check for canonical tx group duplicates | 1 |
| EnableExperimentalAPI | EnableExperimentalAPI enables experimental API endpoint. Note that these endpoints have no<br>guarantees in terms of functionality or future support. | false |
| DisableLedgerLRUCache | DisableLedgerLRUCache disables LRU caches in ledger.<br>Setting it to TRUE might result in significant performance degradation<br>and SHOULD NOT be used for other reasons than testing. | false |
| EnableFollowMode | EnableFollowMode launches the node in "follower" mode. This turns off the agreement service,<br>and APIs related to broadcasting transactions, and enables APIs which can retrieve detailed information<br>from ledger caches and can control the ledger round. | false |
| EnableTxnEvalTracer | EnableTxnEvalTracer turns on features in the BlockEvaluator which collect data on transactions, exposing them via algod APIs.<br>It will store txn deltas created during block evaluation, potentially consuming much larger amounts of memory, | false |
| StorageEngine | StorageEngine allows to control which type of storage to use for the ledger.<br>Available options are:<br>- sqlite (default)<br>- pebbledb (experimental, in development) | sqlite |
| TxIncomingFilterMaxSize | TxIncomingFilterMaxSize sets the maximum size for the de-duplication cache used by the incoming tx filter<br>only relevant if TxIncomingFilteringFlags is non-zero | 500000 |
| BlockServiceMemCap | BlockServiceMemCap is the memory capacity in bytes which is allowed for the block service to use for HTTP block requests.<br>When it exceeds this capacity, it redirects the block requests to a different node | 500000000 |
| P2PEnable | P2PEnable turns on the peer to peer network | false |
| P2PPersistPeerID | P2PPersistPeerID will write the private key used for the node's PeerID to the P2PPrivateKeyLocation.<br>This is only used when P2PEnable is true. If P2PPrivateKey is not specified, it uses the default location. | true |
| P2PPrivateKeyLocation | P2PPrivateKeyLocation allows the user to specify a custom path to the private key used for the node's PeerID.<br>The private key provided must be an ed25519 private key.<br>This is only used when P2PEnable is true. If the parameter is not set, it uses the default location. |  |
| DisableAPIAuth | DisableAPIAuth turns off authentication for public (non-admin) API endpoints. | false |
